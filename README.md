# Bike Sharing Dataset
At https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset is available a bike sharing dataset including the corresponding dataset description.

# Prediction model and evaluation
It is possible to build a prediction model for the hourly utilization “cnt”. In order to evaluate the trained model is used an evaluation dataset with 10% of randomly selected events. As evaluation measure is calculated the MAE (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error).

# Run
run_bike_sharing_analysis.py allows us to build a prediction model based on a specified regressor and to evaluate it.
